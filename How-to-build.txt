== How to build ==

=== general ===
within the project's root you'll find the file "Build.bat"
it will call the Phantom build system, with build.boo as the input file.

you do not need to know anything about Phantom or boo. Just use the Build.bat file and you'll be good

=== The simple case ===
> build
This will build the whole solution in Debug, and run all tests

=== Compile only, no tests ===
> build compile
Will compile the solution in Debug, without running the tests

=== run tests ===
> build tests
will compile and run tests

=== Release mode ===
just add the `release` target. e.g.:

> build release compile
will build the solution in release mode

> build release test
will build the solution in release mode and run the tests
