## MongoDB C# Driver

> This "x2.0" branch is an experimental branch where we are beginning work
> on the 2.0 version of the C# driver. We expect this branch to be quite
> volatile for awhile, so we don't recommend you use it much except as
> a way to track what's changing in 2.0.
>
> Eventually as this work stabilizes it will be merged with master and
> then further work will continue on master.
