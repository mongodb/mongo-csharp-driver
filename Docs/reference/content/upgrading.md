## Breaking Changes

### Backwards compatibility with driver version 2.7.0â€“2.14.x

Starting from 2.15.0, feature detection is implemented through maxWireVersion 
instead of buildInfo. This should have no user-visible impact.

Driver version 2.14.0 and later only supports MongoDB 3.6+. It cannot connect to
clusters running earlier versions of MongoDB. If you need to connect to
an older cluster, please use driver version 2.13.x or earlier.

Starting in 2.11.0, ``BsonSerializer.Serialize`` will throw an
``InvalidOperationException`` when attempting to serialize an array at
the root of a BSON document. Prior versions would allow this invalid operation.
See https://jira.mongodb.org/browse/CSHARP-2877 and
https://jira.mongodb.org/browse/CSHARP-3889 for more details.
