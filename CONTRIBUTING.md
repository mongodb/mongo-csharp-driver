## Contributing to the driver

### Bugfixes

- Before starting to write code, look for existing [tickets](https://jira.mongodb.org/browse/CSHARP#selectedTab=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.project%3Asummary-panel) or create one for your specific issue. That way you avoid working on something that might not be of interest or that has been addressed already in a different branch.
- Fork the [repo](https://github.com/mongodb/mongo-csharp-driver).
- Ensure your core.autocrlf settings are set to true. [see here](http://www.mongodb.org/display/DOCS/CSharp+Driver+Tutorial#CSharpDriverTutorial-Downloading)
- Follow the general coding style of the rest of the project.
- Write tests and make sure they pass. [see here](http://www.mongodb.org/display/DOCS/CSharp+Driver+Tutorial#CSharpDriverTutorial-Runningunittests)
- Your final commit should have the JIRA issue number as the first part of the commit message. [see here](https://github.com/mongodb/mongo-csharp-driver/commit/40e69fe1cf45b0ed9d68a551b0222a140fa26ba2)
- Submit a pull request from github.
