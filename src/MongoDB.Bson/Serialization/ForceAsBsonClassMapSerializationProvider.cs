    /// <summary>
    /// Represents a BSON serialization provider which defines that some serializable types should be treated
    /// as BSON class maps.
    /// </summary>
    /// <remarks>
    /// Argumented types to be forced as BSON class maps can be either concrete or also base class and interface ones.
    /// 
    /// This serialization provider is useful when a class may implement a collection interface (for example, <see cref="System.Collections.Generic.IList{T}"/>)
    /// because the domain requires the class to act as a collection, but in terms of serialization, it must be serialized as a regular
    /// POCO class.
    /// </remarks>
    /// <example>
    /// For example, given the following class:
    /// 
    /// <code language="c#">
    /// public interface ISomeInterface { }
    /// public class SomeImpl : ISomeInterface { }
    /// </code>
    /// 
    /// This provider can be configured both to force any <codeInline>SomeImpl</codeInline> to be treated as 
    /// BSON class map and also any implementation of <codeInline>ISomeInterface</codeInline> can be configured as a 
    /// forced type to let any implementation be serialized as a BSON class map:
    /// 
    /// <code language="c#">
    /// ForceAsBsonClassMapSerializationProvider provider = new ForceAsBsonClassMapSerializationProvider(typeof(SomeImpl));

    /// ForceAsBsonClassMapSerializationProvider provider = new ForceAsBsonClassMapSerializationProvider(typeof(ISomeInterface));
