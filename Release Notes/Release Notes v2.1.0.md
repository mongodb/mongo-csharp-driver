### GridFS

[CSHARP-1191](https://jira.mongodb.org/browse/CSHARP-1191) - GridFS support has been implemented.


### LINQ

[CSHARP-935](https://jira.mongodb.org/browse/CSHARP-935) LINQ support has been rewritten and now targets the aggregation framework. It is a more natural translation and enables many features of LINQ that were previously not able to be translated.

Simply use the new [`AsQueryable`]({{< apiref "M_MongoDB_Driver_IMongoCollectionExtensions_AsQueryable__1" >}}) method to work with LINQ.


### Eventing

[CSHARP-1374](https://jira.mongodb.org/browse/CSHARP-1374) - An eventing API has been added allowing a user to subscribe to one or more events from the core driver for insight into server discovery, server selection, connection pooling, and commands.
