Upgrading

There are no known backwards breaking changes in this release.

If your application is running on Linux or OS X and you were planning to upgrade
to the 2.7.1 release of the driver, you must upgrade to 2.7.2 or later rather than 2.7.1.

In the 2.7.1 release, the driver enables TCP KeepAlive and configures the
KeepAlive interval, but the method that it uses throws a PlatformNotSupportedException
on Linux and OS X. In the 2.7.2 release the driver catches that exception rather than
failing to connect, and falls back to simply enabling KeepAlive. If that also throws a
PlatformNotSupportedException, it will connect without enabling KeepAlive.
