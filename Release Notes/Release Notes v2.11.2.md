## Upgrading

Everyone using versions 2.11.0 or 2.11.1 of the C# driver with version 4.4.0 or later of the server should upgrade to 2.11.2.
The issue fixed is related to simultaneous authentication of two or more connections, in which case a change introduced
in 2.11.0 can result in authentication failing. Under loads low enough that only one connection is ever opened at the same
time the issue does not happen.

See: https://jira.mongodb.org/browse/CSHARP-3196

There are no known backwards breaking changes in this release.
