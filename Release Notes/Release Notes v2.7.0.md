## Upgrading

* The .NET Driver now **disables** certificate revocation checking by default, setting `CheckCertificateRevocation` in `SslSettings` to `false` by default. Any applications relying on the older default of `true` now must explicitly set `CheckCertificateRevocation` to `true` in `SslSettings` to re-enable certificate revocation checking.

  Previously, the driver enabled certificate revocation checking by default, in contrast to the `mongo` shell and other MongoDB drivers. This was also in contrast to .NET's defaults for `SslStream` (see .NET Framework documentation [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.net.security.sslstream.authenticateasclient?view=netframework-4.7.2#System_Net_Security_SslStream_AuthenticateAsClient_System_String_) and .NET Standard documentation [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.net.security.sslstream.authenticateasclient?view=netstandard-2.0#System_Net_Security_SslStream_AuthenticateAsClient_System_String_)).

## Known Issues:

* Incomplete SCRAM-SHA-256 Support in .NET Standard: In .NET Standard, authenticating via SCRAM-SHA-256 may not work with non-ASCII passwords because SaslPrep is not fully implemented due to the lack of a string normalization function in .NET Standard 1.5. Normalizing the password into Unicode Normalization Form KC beforehand MAY help. SCRAM-SHA-1 is the recommended alternative (when targeting .NET Standard) for now.
