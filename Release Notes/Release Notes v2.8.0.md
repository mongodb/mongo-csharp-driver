## Upgrading

* The minimum .NET Framework version we support has been changed from 4.5 to 4.5.2.

* If you were having compatibility problems when adding a dependency (either directly or indirectly) on either
System.Runtime.InteropServices.RuntimeInformation or DnsClient this is a recommended upgrade. We now depend
on the latest version of those packages.
